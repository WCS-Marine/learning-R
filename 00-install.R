# This script is to install and load a few packages in R

# Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format
# We will install a few packages first
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("reshape2")

# Once a package is installed, we need to 'load' it so we can use it during our R session
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
